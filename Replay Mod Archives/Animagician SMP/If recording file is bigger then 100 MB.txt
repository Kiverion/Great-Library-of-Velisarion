If the recording file is too big to upload (100MB+) then:

1. open Minecraft
2. go into your replay recording selection screen on the main menu
3. select the recording that is too big
4. select Edit
5. click somewhere on the timeline where you want to split the recording
6. select Insert split
7. Apply and wait for the split to finish

Then, you can upload the two or more split files to the github instead, 
since Github's limit is on individual file size and not total file size of all files
